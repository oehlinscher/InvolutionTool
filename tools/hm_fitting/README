1. Determine MIS delays for falling and rising output 
    a. Determine MIS delays for falling outputs
        * Run generateStimuli.py for falling output transitions
        * Copy input stimuli to spice file
        * Adjust <STOPTIME> in spice file
        * Run make crossings
        * Copy crossings.json file to folder hm_fitting in the circuit folder and rename to crossings_falling_output.json
    b. Repeat the same steps to determine MIS delays for rising output transitions and rename crossings.json to crossings_rising_output.json

2. Plot spice figures by running plotSpiceFig.py

3. Based on the delays from the previous step, run the parameter fitting script (parameterFitting.py)

4. Based on the parameters, execute the simulation script to get the MIS delays for falling and rising output (simulate.py)

5. Compare SPICE and ODE (compareFigs.py)
