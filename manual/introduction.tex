The Involution Tool (\invt) is a framework for comparing different digital 
delay prediction methods, especially the involution delay model and the 
standard \modelsim\ model, with an analog \spice\ reference. The results are 
compared in terms of several metrics, see Section~\ref{sec:man-evaluation}.
Since the input waveforms are generated randomly, and several parameters can be 
adjusted for the involution delay model, the \invt\ also offers an opportunity 
to invoke the toolchain several times (see 
Section~\ref{sec:man-multi-execution}), in order to obtain meaningful results 
and find the best fitting parameters.
