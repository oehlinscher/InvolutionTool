For plotting the results of the \multiexec\ tool a Python script is used, which 
uses matplotlib to display the results. 
In order to work with the script the \file{results.csv} file has to be 
converted into an \file{evaluation.csv} file, where only the aggregated results 
are contained. 

Currently, this conversion step is performed manually. 
The steps which have to be made are described in the \file{README} file. 
Of course, future versions of the plotting script should be able to automate 
this process.

Since more than 20 metrics are supported, and result files can easily contain 
more than 20 different configurations, the script offers the possibility to 
filter for certain metrics and configurations. 
Otherwise, the plots would be too overloaded.
For information on how to filter for specific metrics and configurations, 
please refer to the \file{README}.
