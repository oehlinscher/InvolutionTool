Generating the matching for the \mipsclocknm{15} circuit was a very tedious and 
error prone task. Therefore we created a Python script which extracts the 
matching between the \spfile\ and \file{*.v} file.

The script extracts all gate outputs from the \spfile\ and tries to find the 
corresponding outputs in the \file{*.v}.

Note that this script is only working for the \mipsclocknm{15} circuit, and 
that implementing a general script for generating the matching is a very 
demanding task.
