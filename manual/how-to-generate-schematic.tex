How to create schematic from verilog file: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Start \emph{design\_vision}
\item File $\rightarrow$ Setup: Set search path for libraries $\rightarrow$ 
Apply 
\item File $\rightarrow$ Analyze $\rightarrow$ add vhdl File 
\item File $\rightarrow$ Elaborate 
\item Schematic $\rightarrow$ New Schematic View 
\item View $\rightarrow$ Save Screenshot As $\rightarrow$ Grab Screenshot of 
active view only 
\item Paint.NET invert colors (optional, because the background of the 
schematic is black, and this is probably not optimal for printing the report)
\end{itemize}
